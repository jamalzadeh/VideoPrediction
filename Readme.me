1. Run "RandomVideo.py" to generate training set for training the CNN model (Balls at random locations). This file will create videos and a csv file which shows the position of balls in each video at each frame.
2. Run "VideoPrediction.ipynb" to train the CNN model from the videos generated from previous step.
3. Run "VideoPrediction.ipynb" to generate real videos of moving balls and localize them in each frame using the CNN model which was trained in last step. Finally, it will give the preiction of CNN model and visualize the results in a video.
